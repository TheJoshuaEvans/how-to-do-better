## Introduction

I am always trying to improve myself. I know that perfection is impossible, and so, I know that I will never be done trying. Still, the challenge remains. For many years I have pondered how I can do better and implemented many strategies, but I never really wrote any of it down. I just didn't feel ready to, I guess

However, drifting through life I recently realized that I had been blatantly ignoring some of the lessons I had already painstakingly learned. I forgot about them. So it's time to start writing. This is mainly for my own edification, and I plan on expanding and updating this list over time. This is public because, maybe it could help other people too

One thing I have learned is that doing the right thing isn't easy. We humans seem predisposed to just making things worse for ourselves - a result of how technology has progressed faster then evolution could ever hope to match. A lot of these ideas are pretty simple, and kinda obvious, but there is a big difference between knowing about these directives and actually practicing them. One of the freeing things about never being able to achieve perfection is that we will inevitably fail - so we might as well get used to the idea. When this happens, all we can do is pick ourselves up, try again, and to learn from our mistakes to _do better_

What does it mean to "do better" though? That's the real question. Ultimately we all have to choose what it means for ourselves. For me, it means to **make the world a better place**; which is purposely vague. The world is remarkably complex, and so "making the world a better place" will mean different things in different places and times. We have to make our own moral judgments about what it means at any given time, which is already pretty difficult. Though, generally I like to stick to the standard of trying to make choices that will have the most positive impact on the individuals effected, or will at the very least minimize the negative impacts. Plus, we live in the world, so when we do this we make our own environments better to live in

One of the greatest benefits of making the world a better place, I have found, is that good deeds and kindness have a tendency to come back to us. People *like* people who are kind, honest, and trustworthy - and the most effective way to convince others we are those things is... to just *be* kind, honest, and trustworthy. Of course, it's sounds simple to say, but it's a lot harder to actually do

Firstly, we have to deal with an apparent moral paradox. Humans can be extremely good at detecting when somebody is being insincere, so it's not efficient to do this by only pretending to be these things for our own benefits. We may be able to entangle millions of people into our selfish web, but there will always be millions more that see right through it (of course, history is littered with people who have done this to the ruin of many, but these people are few and far between - we will most likely not be one of them. Plus, it often ends quite badly for them)

To maximize our "likability" we must truly be kind, honest, and trustworthy. Once we understand that, can we really be altruistic if we know we will likely gain in some way by behaving altruistically? If I do a good deed, and I am actively aware of the fact that by doing that good deed I made my environment a better place to live in, directly improving my own life, did I do that good deed for "the right reasons"? Can I do any good deed for "the right reasons"?

We can leave this debate to the philosophers and do like scientists do - pick explanations and definitions that are *useful*, even if they might not necessarily be completely true (but are mostly true). I think it's still possible to be altruistic and understand the benefits of altruism because I *want* to be altruistic and I happen to already understand the benefits

Secondly, it can take a lot of energy and active attention to do some of these things. Some things that are good to do, like admitting when we are wrong, or wronged another, can even be physically painful to do. It is difficult to remember and correctly differentiate between things we can share and things we should keep in confidence. We must put systems in place to make sure we remember promises and dates. The effort is endless

In a way, we can think of improving the world as equivalent to contributing to the eternal fight against entropy. We are destined to fail, but it is the very nature of living things to rebel against the universe's unyielding collapse into cold, dark, homogeneity. It's natural then, even expected, that it takes energy to contribute to this fight. Needless to say, it's a lot easier to not spend entergy then it is to spend it - and for hundreds of thousands of years our ancestors survived and thrived by being as efficient with their energy as possible

We can persevere, though. The key to all of this, the most important thing to always remember, is to **never give up**
